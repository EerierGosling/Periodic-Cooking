### Project Summary
We ended up making a Unity-based science & cooking game to help others know how to combine made-up elements and strengthen their reading and computer skills. 

This is far from what we started with, we initally had the idea of creating a hot-potato launcher system using the waffle iron, a spring, and a motor in which a person would catch the hot potato with a baseball glove after loosing the game.

We struggled with our inital idea due to time and hardware-resource contrsaints, but we generally agreed that it would be a good idea if there were no roadblocks.

### How did the items in your box inspire you?
I think our box was quite well put together and only after 5 minutes of recieving the box, did group members start brainstorming possible ideas. People like french fries, and we had potatoes and a skillet, so we first came up with french-fry-centered ideas.

### What items did you use?
We mainly used the periodic tables, a fan motor, the clorax disinfecting wipes, not as much as we hoped to use but we had fun with it.
